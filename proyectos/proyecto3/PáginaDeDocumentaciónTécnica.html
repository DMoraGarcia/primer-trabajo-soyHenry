                    Clear! The classic "Hello, World!" is a simple program that is commonly used to introduce beginners to the world of programming. 
                    In Python, the program "Hello, World!" can be written with just one line of code:
                </p>
                <code>
                    print("Hello, world!")
                </code>

                <p>
                    Variables in Python are containers of information! They are tags that are used to store data in the computer's memory. Here are details about variables in Python:
                </p>
                <ol start="1">
                    <li>
                        Declaration and Assignment:
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        In Python, variables are created by assigning a value to them using the "=" assignment operator. You do not need to declare the variable type explicitly. For example:
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <code>
                    x = 5
                    <br>
                    nombre = "Ejemplo"
                </code>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            They must begin with a letter or an underscore ("_").
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Python is case sensitive in variable names ("my_variable" is different from "my_Variable").
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    In Python, declaring a variable is a simple process. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require an explicit declaration of the variable type. 
                    Here is a detailed guide on how to declare variables in Python:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Asignación de Variables:
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        En Python, la asignación de una variable se realiza utilizando el operador =. No es necesario declarar el tipo de variable antes de asignar un valor a la misma. 
                        Ejemplo:
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <code>
                    x = 5
                    <br>
                    nombre = "Juan"
                    <br>
                    pi = 3.14

                    <li>
                        Rules for variable names:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            They can begin with a letter (upper or lower case) or with an underscore "_".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They can contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, or underscores.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Python is case sensitive in variable names.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You cannot use Python reserved words as variable names (<wrap>"if", "else", "for",</wrap> etc.).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to specify the type of the variable when declaring it. 
                        The type of the variable is automatically inferred based on the assigned value. 
                        Example:
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <code>
                    x = 5
                    <br>
                    x = "Hola"
                    <br>
                    x = 3.14
                </code>

                    <li>
                        Naming Conventions:
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        It is recommended to follow the naming conventions for writing variables in Python:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Follow the snake_case style, which consists of lowercase words separated by underscores.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Example:
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <code>
                    nombre_completo = "Ana López"
                    <br>
                    numero_de_telefono = "123456789"

                    <p>
                        You can reassign values ​​to variables at any time. Python allows a variable to change type or value during program execution. 
                        Example:

                        You can delete a variable using the del statement.

                <p>
                    In short, in Python, declaring variables is simple and does not require an explicit type declaration. 
                    The inherent flexibility of variables in Python is one of the features that makes this language very versatile and easy to use.

                    The scope of a variable in Python refers to the region of the code where that variable is accessible. 
                    Python has clear variable scope rules that determine where a variable can be used or referenced.

                <p>
                    Global variables in Python are those defined outside of any function or in a global scope. 
                    These variables can be accessed and modified both inside and outside of functions in the program. Here are details about global variables in Python:

                    variable_global = 10 
                </code>
                <p>
                    In this example, "global_variable" is defined outside of any function, making it a global variable. 
                    It can be accessed and modified from any part of the program, both inside and outside of functions.

                <p>
                    Global variables can be read into a function without declaring them global. However, if you are attempting to modify a global variable within a function, 
                    you must explicitly declare that variable as global using the global keyword.

                        <wrap>Impact on readability and maintainability</wrap>: Global variables can be modified from anywhere in the program, which can make tracking changes in value more complex.

                    <li>
                        <wrap>Modify with caution</wrap>: If global variables are modified from functions, it is essential to keep a clear track of the changes to avoid unwanted side effects on the code.

                <p>
                    Global variables can be useful, but it is recommended that they be used with caution to keep the code clear and maintainable. 
                    In many cases, local variables passed as parameters to functions are preferred rather than relying too much on global variables.

                <p>
                    In Python, there is no specific data type for constants like in some other programming languages. 
                    However, a convention is followed to declare variables whose value is considered constant during program execution.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Convention for Constants in Python:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Constants in Python are named in uppercase letters to indicate that their value should not be modified throughout the program. 
                    Although these variables can be reassigned, programmers are expected not to do so due to the naming convention.
                    <br>
                    Example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    PI = 3.14159
                    <br>
                    LIMITE_SUPERIOR = 100
                    <br>
                    NOMBRE_EMPRESA = "Mi Empresa"
                </code>
                <h3>
                    Good Practices for Using Constants:
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <wrap>Clear naming</wrap>: Constants are named in capital letters and with underscores to improve the readability of the code and to emphasize that they should not be modified.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <wrap>Avoid reassignment</wrap>: Although Python allows variables to be reassigned, it is recommended not to modify variables that have been defined as constants to maintain the integrity of the code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <wrap>Clear documentation</wrap>: It is helpful to add comments or documentation that explains the purpose and use of constants in the code.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>
                    Practical Approach:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Although Python does not have a specific data type for constants, using the uppercase naming convention helps developers identify and treat these variables as constants. 
                    Constants are useful for defining values ​​that do not change during program execution and provide clear context about their meaning and use in code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that these conventions are recommended practices, but they do not prevent variables defined as constants from being reassigned. 
                    The main emphasis is on code clarity and communicating the intention that certain values ​​should not be modified.

                    In Python, data types define the characteristics of the values ​​that can be stored and manipulated in code. 
                    Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the data type of a variable is automatically inferred based on the value assigned to it.

                    The while statement in Python is a control flow structure used to repeat a block of code as long as a specific condition is true. 
                    This structure is called a loop because it repeatedly executes a set of statements as long as the condition evaluates to True. Here is a detailed explanation of while:

                    <br>
                    while contador < 5:

                    Explanation:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The condition is evaluated after the while. If the condition is True, the indented code block is executed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the code block is executed, the condition is evaluated again. If the condition is still true, the cycle repeats. This process continues until the condition evaluates to False.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is important to ensure that the condition in the while eventually returns False to avoid an infinite loop.

                        The while loop is useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition.

                    <li>
                        You should use caution when using a while loop, because if the condition never evaluates to False, it can cause an infinite loop and block program execution.

                    The while loop is a powerful tool for repeating blocks of code in Python as long as a specific condition is met, providing flexibility in executing repetitive tasks.
